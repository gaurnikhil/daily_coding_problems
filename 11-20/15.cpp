// Proof the it's a uniform probablity function -:
// We need to prove that every element is picked with 1/n probability where n is the number of items seen so far. For every new stream item x, we pick a random number from 0 to ‘count -1’, if the picked number is ‘count-1’, we replace the previous result with x.

// To simplify proof, let us first consider the last element, the last element replaces the previously-stored result with 1/n probability. So the probability of getting the last element as the result is 1/n.

// Let us now talk about the second last element. When the second last element processed the first time, the probability that it replaced the previous result is 1/(n-1). The probability that the previous result stays when the nth item is considered is (n-1)/n. So the probability that the second last element is picked in the last iteration is [1/(n-1)] * [(n-1)/n] which is 1/n.

// Similarly, we can prove for third last element and others.
